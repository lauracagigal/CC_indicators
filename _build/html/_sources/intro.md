# Introduction

This repository aims to analyze atmospheric and oceanic variables in different locations of the Pacific Ocean. The analysis is conducted using Jupyter notebooks, which are hosted in the following Jupyter Book: [https://lauracagigal.github.io/CC_indicators/](https://lauracagigal.github.io/CC_indicators/).

The main goal of this analysis is to study the impact of climate change on the Pacific Ocean and its surrounding regions. By examining various indicators such as sea surface temperature, ocean currents, and atmospheric pressure, we can gain insights into the changing climate patterns and their potential consequences.

The Jupyter notebooks in this repository provide step-by-step instructions on how to retrieve and process the data, perform statistical analysis, and visualize the results. They are designed to be accessible to both researchers and students interested in studying climate change and its effects on the Pacific Ocean.

We encourage collaboration and contributions from the scientific community. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional data sources that could enhance our analysis, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue on our GitHub repository.

Let's work together to deepen our understanding of climate change and its impact on the Pacific Ocean!
