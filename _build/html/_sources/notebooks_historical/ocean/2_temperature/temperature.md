# Sea Surface Temperature

Sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the most well-known and widely observed measures of long-term global climate change.  Changes in SST are used to track modes of natural climate variability such as the ENSO and the IPO/PDO, that affect patterns of wind and rain as well as ocean circulation.  Changes in ocean surface temperature have important ramifications for marine ecosystems. They influence species distribution, growth, and lifespan, and alter their migration and breeding patterns.  Increases in SST can threaten sensitive ecosystems such as coral reefs, where high temperatures over extended periods can lead to severe, widespread bleaching and significant coral mortality.

In this section we look at two indicators of change in sea surface temperature.  Using the NOAA OISSTv2 satellite data, we will create plots and maps that show changes in mean surface temperature.  We will also create a create a plot showing changes in Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) using the NOAA Coral Reef Watch (CRW) daily global 5km satellite coral bleaching DHW product. DHW values are directly related to the timing and intensity of coral bleaching.
