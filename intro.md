# Trainind book for the Palau Climate Change Monitor

<br>
This Jupyter Book contains the products and associated code used to generate the Palau Climate Change Monitor, a report that draws on the latest meteorological and oceanographic data and analyses to document observed long-term changes in climate in and around the Republic of Palau.  This Training Book is intended to support capacity building related to the use of the underlying Jupyter Notebooks and GitHub Repository that enable creation of the Palau Monitor, and serve as a template for the creation of similar national climate indicator reports for other Pacific Island nations and territories.  

In the Palau Monitor the state of knowledge about rapid climate change in and around Palau is characterized via a set of environmental indicators. Attention is given to two broad categories of indicators: the atmosphere and the ocean, each in separate sections with individual indicators.  This Training Book follows that same outline as does the Palau Product Summary Matrix, where products and associated code can also be. accessed: https://lauracagigal.github.io/CC_indicators/extra/matrix_cc/index.html
The full GitHub Repository, Jupyter Notebooks, and supporting materials can be accessed here: https://github.com/lauracagigal/CC_indicators?tab=readme-ov-file 
This report was produced by NOAAâ€™s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) working in partnership with the Palau Office of Climate Change and other agencies, organizations and institutions in the **Republic of Palau**.
