# Atmosphere

## Greenhouse Gases
Greenhouse gases are gases in the Earth's atmosphere that trap heat and contribute to the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming and climate change.

## Surface Temperature
Surface temperature refers to the temperature of the Earth's surface, which is influenced by various factors such as solar radiation, greenhouse gases, and land use changes. Monitoring surface temperature helps understand climate patterns and detect changes over time.

## Rainfall
Rainfall refers to the amount of precipitation in the form of rain that occurs in a specific area over a given period of time. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important for understanding climate variability and its impact on ecosystems, agriculture, and water resources.

## Tropical Cyclones
Tropical cyclones, also known as hurricanes or typhoons, are intense low-pressure systems that form over warm ocean waters. They are characterized by strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. Monitoring tropical cyclones helps assess their frequency, intensity, and potential impact on coastal areas.
