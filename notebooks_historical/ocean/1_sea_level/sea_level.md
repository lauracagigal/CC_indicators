## Highlights

- Satellite measurements of global sea level indicate that the mean sea level in the vicinity of the Malakal tide gauge has risen by 17.34 cm (6.82 in) since 1993.  This compares to a value of 12.26 cm (4.83 in) measured by the tide gauge over this same time period.  These differences are largely attributable to vertical land motion.
- In response to ENSO, sea level varies dramatically in Palau.  For example, the 1997-1998 El Niño produced water levels nearly 30 cm below the average sea level and the corresponding 1998-2001 La Niña produced values over 35 cm above the average sea level.
- Consistent with the rising trends in mean sea level, minor flood frequency increased at a statistically significant (p < 0.05) rate of 0.95 days per year over the period 1983-2024. 
- During the decade 2013–2023 relative to the decade 1983–1993, minor flood counts increased in Palau from 18 to 48 times a year (a 167% increase, or nearly 3-fold). 
- High yearly flood event clustering occurs in conjunction with La Niña events. In contrast, El Niño is rarely associated with high counts of minor flood days. 
- Minor flooding has a pronounced seasonality.  Minor flooding during the four months July-October comprise 50% of all minor flooding days.


## Background

Changes in mean sea level are indicative of overall warming of the ocean and melting of ice on land. Rising sea level is a crucial issue for many islands in the Pacific. It causes ocean inundation, increased coastal flooding when coupled with waves, and shoreline erosion that leads to building and infrastructure damage.  Impacts of higher sea levels also occur as a result of saltwater intrusion and inundation of aquifers and other domestic water supplies, and salinization and flood damage to agriculture.

Sea level trends measured in many Pacific Islands differ relative to the absolute change in global mean sea level (GMSL), depending on the location and year. Several factors contribute to this spatial and temporal variability.  There are contrasting regional fingerprints in sea level rise (SLR) caused by global warming.  Natural climate variability is associated with large sea level fluctuations in the tropical western and Pacific.  Naturally-occurring regional SLR variations due to ENSO on interannual time scales, and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO)/Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) on decadal to multi-decadal time scales can amplify or dampen the underlying trends arising from global warming., with below-normal sea levels during El Niño events and above-normal sea levels during La Niña.  There are also factors other than climate variability that can have a strong effect on coastal sea levels in Pacific Islands. Vertical land motion (e.g., associated with some earthquakes) is large for several Pacific Islands (e.g., the the Samoan Archipelago) and can account for substantial differences in sea level trends measured by tide gauges and satellites, because the tide gauge instruments record water levels relative to the elevation of the land. 

Local sea level variability and trends account for substantial changes in minor flooding.  Minor flooding (also commonly referred to as high or king tide flooding, nuisance flooding) can occur when exceptionally high tides combine with large waves and/or other oceanic and atmospheric phenomena that raise the coastal water level.  Though their impacts are less than major floods, which occur during severe storms, the cumulative impacts associated with minor flooding can be considerable.
